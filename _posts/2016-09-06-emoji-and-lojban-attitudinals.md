title: Emoji and Lojban attitudinals
tags: [lojban, attitudinals, emoji]

😀 I like learning the Lojban language. 🤓 Especially the class of words known as "attitudinals" I find interesting because they are essentially spoken emotions.  🤔 I thought I might practice by mapping emoji to attidudinals and vice versa. 

🤔 There are 39 attitudinals in Lojban. (See this [page](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lojban/Attitudinals) for a list of all of them)

For some emoji it is quite easy to see what emotion they convey:

Lojban |Emotion |representation |
---|---|---|
 😀 | ui			| [happiness]  |
 😍 | iu			| [love]  |
 😱 | ii			| [fear] |
 😂 | u'i		| [amusement] |

Some emoji express emotions more strongly than others. Lojban has some emotional modifiers to indicate a stronger emotion (-sai), a weaker emotion (-ru'e), the lack of emotion (-cu'i) or the opposite emotion (-nai):

Lojban |Emotion |representation |
---|---|---|
 🙁 | uinai		| [unhappiness] |
 😀 | ui			| [happiness]  |
 🙂 | uiru'e		| [happiness][weak] |
 😄 | uisai		| [happiness][strong] |
 ☹️ | uinaisai	| [unhappiness][strong] |
 😡 | o'onaicai	| [anger][very strong]  |

There are also modifiers in Lojban to change the category of the emotion:

Lojban|Emotion |representation|
---|---|---|
 🤓 | uiro'e		| [happiness][intellectual] |
 😭 | o'unairo'i| [stress][emotional] |
 😘 | auro'u		| [desire][sexual] |
 😋 | auro'o		| [desire][physical] |

Here is an attempt to find suitable emoji for all attidutinals that start with the letter 'u':

Attitudinal | (nothing) | -cu'i | -nai  |
---|---|---|---|
.ua | discovery 🤔|  | confusion 😕 |
.u'a | gain 🤑|  | loss  |
.ue | surprise 😲| no surprise | expectation  |
.u'e | wonder 😯|  | commonplace  |
.ui | happiness 😀|  | unhappiness 🙁| 
.u'i | amusement 😂|  | weariness 😩 |
.uo | completion 😌|  | incompleteness 😣 |
.u'o | courage | timidity | cowardice 😰 |
.uu | pity 😔|  | cruelty  |
.u'u | repentance 😬| lack of regret | innocence 😇 |

And those starting with 'i':

Attitudinal | (nothing) | -cu'i | -nai  |
---|---|---|---|
.ii | fear 😱| nervousness 😰| security  |
.i'i | togetherness 🤗|  | privacy 🤐  |
.io | respect | lack of respect | disrespect |  
.i'o | appreciation 🤗| lack of appreciation | envy |  
.iu | love 😍| lack of love | hatred/fear 😠 
.i'u | familiarity 😙|  | mystery 😶 


😀 I was quite pleased to find that I could find a suitable emoji for many of the Lojban attitudinals above. 🤓 I learned that Lojban attitudinals are much more precise than emoji. 😮 Looking at the Unicode codepoint names for emoij reveals that many of them are only described by their facial feature rather than the emotion that is being conveyed. 

Here are some miscellaneous emoji:

Emoji | | |
---|---|---|
😥 | uinai.o'u | [unhappiness][relaxation] |
😖 | oiro'i.a'onai | [pain][emotional][despair] |
😈 | uivu'enai | [happy][evil] |
👿 | uinaivu'enai | [unhappy][evil] |
😜 | zo'o | [humorously] |
